# ✈️ Flight Time Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight times to classify them as **Early**, **Late**, or **On Time** based on a comprehensive set of influencing factors. Utilizing various machine learning algorithms, our model achieved an accuracy of **80%**, the highest in our class!

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Sources:** Utilizes a rich dataset comprising:
  - Weather data
  - Airline data
  - Historical flight data
  - Current weather data
  - Airport congestion data
  - Flight capacity and wind flow
  - Average airport security congestion

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented multiple combinations of machine learning models to enhance prediction capabilities.

- **Classification Accuracy:** Achieved **80%** accuracy in predicting flight statuses.

## 📊 Data Overview
The dataset includes various features that impact flight delays, such as:
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Airline-specific data (flight schedules, operational history)
- Historical delays
- Real-time airport conditions (congestion, security checks)
